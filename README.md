# Gnomenclature

A tool to practice inorganic chemical nomenclature.

Written by Ben Cook <b@bencook.ca>

## Installation

This is a tiny [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) app packaged for NPM.

If you don't have Node installed, go do that and come back. It's ok, I'll be here.
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com) will be needed as well if you want to edit the CSS,
although the Sass-rendered CSS is available in the repo as well.

1. `git clone https://github.com/blx/gnomenclature`
2. `cd gnomenclature`
3. `npm install`

Now `./watch` will run a development environment, serving the site on localhost:3000
and having Sass watch for changes and automatically regenerate the CSS.

Alternatively, just `node gnne.js` will spin up the server.
